# odin-to-do-list

## To-do List project from The Odin Project

Tasks are locally saved using localStorage module. Currently still implementing basic project functionality. This README is currently serving as a pseudo to-do list for my outstanding items to get this project where I want it. Ironic!

**Current task:** ability to edit projects

**Outstanding tasks:** ability to DELETE existing tasks, display all of today's tasks, display all important tasks, change displayed tasks by project

**Known Issues:** localStorage module integration
