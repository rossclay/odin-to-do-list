# odin-to-do-list

## To-do List project from The Odin Project

Tasks are locally saved using localStorage module. Currently still implementing basic project functionality. This README is currently serving as a pseudo to-do list for my outstanding items to get this project where I want it. Ironic!

**Current task:** ability to DELETE existing tasks, ability to delete projects,

**Outstanding tasks:** display all of today's tasks, display all important tasks

**Known Issues:** localStorage module integration, when projects are deleted, the event listener to populate the DOM with their tasks is also firing. better event delegation may solve this.
