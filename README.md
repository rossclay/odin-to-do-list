#odin-to-do-list
To-do List project from The Odin Project. Tasks are locally saved using localStorage module. Currently still implementing basic project functionality. This README is currently serving as a pseudo to-do list for my outstanding items to get this project where i want it. ironic!
Current task: ability to edit existing tasks
Outstanding tasks: ability to edit projects, display all of today's tasks, display all important tasks, change displayed tasks by project, taskCheckBox should also update the task object's completion status and not just the DOM
Known Issues: localStorage module integration
