# odin-to-do-list

## To-do List project from The Odin Project

Tasks are locally saved using localStorage module. Currently still implementing basic project functionality. This README is currently serving as a pseudo to-do list for my outstanding items to get this project where I want it. Ironic!

**Current task:** localStorage module integration, tasks cannot be deleted or edited while in today's tasks, all tasks, or important tasks view

**Outstanding tasks:** improve event delegation for brevity

**Known Issues:** localStorage module integration, tasks cannot be deleted or edited while in today's tasks, all tasks, or important tasks view
